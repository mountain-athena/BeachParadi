<div id="Bay">
  <h3> Bay of Bahia </h3>
  <p>Nestled on the nothern end of the Isle of Caludge,
    this beach is cited as the most popular getaway for
    vacationers during peak summer months.  Popular
    activities include scuba diving, snorkeling, and bird
    watching.</p>

  <h3> Selange Beach </h3>
  <p> Selange Beach is known for its temerate sand.  Made
    up of ground coral due to thousands of years of tectonic
    activity, the sand is always cool to the touch, despite
    the heat. The western portion includes fantastic flora
    and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.</p>

<div id="hunt">
  <h3> Hunt Lagoon </h3>
  <p> Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island
    (which includes swimming through an underground cave), Hunt
    Lagoon offers a peaceful respite from the tourist-laden locations
    found throughout Kamar. If possible, make a visit at night -
    its bioluminecsent lagoon is like viewing fireworks in the
    water! </p>

<div id="moat">
  <h3> Moat Lagoon </h3>
  <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the
    most difficult beach location to access. The lagoon is  located
    inside of a prehistoric centoe, or underground aquifer.  Accessin it
    involves crossing the moat surrounded by the lagoon (hence the name)
    with locals by kayak. Once there, marvel at teh phenomenal (and endangered)
    quetzal and its golden feathers.</p>
